#### An app designed to address the 'invisible load' carried by women
Developed by **TechTonic Titans** 

![FairPlay LOGO](https://i.ibb.co/ZGNT1tw/houselogo3.jpg)

### App overview
FairPlay is an organizational app designed to promote equitable task distribution within households, aiming to ease the disproportionate burden often carried by women. Inspired by the concept of the "invisible load" discussed in Regina F. Lark's TED talk, the app seeks to address the complexities of emotional labor and household management carried by women.

Whether it's stress management, fair task allocation among partners and family members, FairPlay serves as a tool for fostering a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. By facilitating transparent communication and collaboration, our goal is to dismantle stereotypes and promote equality in domestic responsibilities.

Join us in challenging societal norms and empowering individuals to share the load, creating healthier and happier homes one step at a time.

### Inspiration
 The idea behind FairPlay was sparked by Regina F. Lark's TED talk, [Emotional labor and the myth of "women's work" by Regina F. Lark | TEDxFolsom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJLawgDbn_E), shedding light on women's unseen contributions in various aspects of life, particularly household management and motherhood.

## Planning & Design

### Agile Development
The development process for this project followed an Agile methodology, emphasizing continuous improvement throughout the development lifecycle. We assigned tasks to each others and this helped us distribute workload efficiently, ensuring clarity on responsibilities.

Project Management: we utilised GitHub Project boards to manage tasks, user stories, and project progression effectively.

## Existing Features 
### Logo 
![LOGO](https://i.ibb.co/k5dw9wN/my-screenshots-2024-04-24-at-18-11-51.png)

The logo of our app embodies the essence of household organization and teamwork. It features a stylized depiction of a home, symbolizing the household environment and the tasks associated with it. Above the home, hands are joined together, forming a roof-like structure that represents collaboration and teamwork within the household.

**Home Symbolism**: The home symbolizes the heart of the household, where tasks and responsibilities are managed and organized. It reflects the central focus of our app on helping users streamline their household tasks and routines.
**Hands as a Roof**: The hands forming a roof above the home signify the collective effort and support within the household. They represent the collaborative spirit and teamwork among family members or housemates in accomplishing tasks and maintaining a well-organized home environment.

### Favicon
The logo was used as favicon.

### Homepage

The homepage serves as the central hub, offering quick access to various sections of the app. It provides an overview of the available features and serves as a starting point for users.

**Description of the app in the homepage**:
> Women still shoulder a disproportionate amount of the housework: the “Invisible Load”, especially mothers, who often have even less time and emotional bandwidth to deal with this burden. FairPlay is here to help alleviate the chores, levitate above them and elevate your relationship with your partner to a new emotional level. 

> FairPlay is designed as a “partnership tool” rather than a “management tool”. Together with your partner, you both manage and help each other tackle everyday housework as you’re working towards a common goal that you both set yourself, be it a romantic night out at your favourite local restaurant or a cosy night in, cuddled up on the sofa, watching that film you both went to see on your first date.

Functionalities available in the homepage:
- Get reminder to accomplish tasks
![]()

- Personalise tasks and names

- Set a common reward 

- Set reminder for important dates
